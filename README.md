# Neuron-Simulation
Java-based simulation of neural networks using OOP principles
This project is a Java-based simulation of neurons and their interactions using object-oriented programming principles.

## Features:
- Models regular and cumulative neurons
- Simulates stimulus propagation across neurons
- Provides customizable neural networks

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Neuron-Simulation.git`
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run the `SimulateurNeurone` class to start the simulation.
